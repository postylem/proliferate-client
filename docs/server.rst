=======================================

The server component manages the participant data storage both from the participant's side and
the experimenter's side. The :doc:`JavaScript library </javascript-library>` sends participant's data to the server for
permanent storage and the :doc:`command line interface </command-line-interface>` and the web interface communicate with the server to
create and manage experiments, as well as to download data from an experiment. 

The server is hosted by the `Stanford ALPS lab <http://alpslab.stanford.edu>`_ at
