# Proliferate CLI client

A tool for managing experiments on [Proliferate](https://proliferate.alps.science). This tool makes it easy to create new experiments to be published on [Prolific](https://prolific.co) and to download data.

The behavior is similar to various versions of [Submiterator](https://github.com/sebschu/Submiterator) but is intended to be used with Proliferate and Prolific.
